# Simple model
## Simple model can not model signal for correct T2 and therefore shows large differences for larger T2 values.
## Those are excluded for testing, because they are not relevant for the analysis here and too far off.

# Other models
## Tube with largest T2 shows larger differences. It is outside the relevant area and is therefore not tested
